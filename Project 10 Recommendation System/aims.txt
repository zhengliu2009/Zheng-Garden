In this assignment, your tasks are to build recommender systems based on user's interests and past activities. This dataset was drawn from the social talk and seminar website named CoMeT (http://pittsburgh.comettalks.com). It provides the local Pittsburgh talks and online webinars for research communities and enthusiasts.

The dataset contains two files:

talk.txt
user_view.txt
First of all, randomly split 80/10/10 (more or less) of the data as the training/validation/test sets. You can split them based on users and keep all talks, OR separate them based on talks and use all the users.

Task 1: Content-based Recommendation
1.1) TF-IDF Model

Convert the textual fields (title and detail) of each talk from the talk.txt to TF-IDF vectors. To simplify the task, exclude the talk's statistics and types of talk features. Use scikit-learn or gensim libraries or write your own.
Build the "seen" user profile vector space model by averaging the talk vectors that users have seen user_view.txt.
Build a recommender that from what user has seen (training set), predicts which talk user will view (in the validation and test sets).
Report the accuracy of the training/validation/test sets.
1.2) Word Embedding Model

Convert the textual fields (title and detail) of each talk from the talk.txt to word vectors. To simplify the task, exclude the talk's statistics and types of talk features.

Build the "seen" user profile vector space model by averaging the talk vectors that users have seen.

Build a recommender that from what user has seen (training set), predicts which talk user will view (in the validation and test sets).
Report the results on the training/validation/test sets.
Task 2: Collaborative Filtering

From the training set, convert the user_view.txt into a user-talk matrix.

2.1) User-based/Item-based Collaborative Filtering

Follow and adapt from this tutorial.
Report the results on the training/validation/test sets.
2.2) Matrix Factorization

Follow and adapt from this tutorial.
Report the results on the training/validation/test sets.
Task 3: Ensemble - Hybrid Recommendation
3.1) Ensemble

Use Talks' statistic and other meta-data along with the new features that you create more to combine these feature with the outputs from task 1 and task 2.
Create an ensemble classifier (linear or non-linear).
Report the results on the training/validation/test sets.
